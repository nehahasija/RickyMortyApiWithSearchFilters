# RickyMortyApiWithSearchFilters

The task  is to call the Rick And Morty API from an app and realize the following process:
1. Initially, all characters are  loaded from the API and displayed as a list.
2. As the API only returns 20 results at a time but supports pagination, so whenever list is scrolled new page items should be loaded and shown.
3. There is a  search box on top of list, from which you could filter out the results.
4. Each item in a list have following property displayed initially: image, name, status, species, last known location and first seen in. Refer home page of rick and morty api for design inspiration.
5. When clicked on last known location, user is redirected to a new screen where location details are mentioned, you can use whatever property you liked from location schema(https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#location-schema).
6. When clicked on first seen in, user is redirected to a new screen where episode details are mentioned, you can use whatever property you liked from episode schema(https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#episode-schema).
7. User should be able to navigate back to the home screen.
